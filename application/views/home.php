				<h2 class="h" > Welcome to Document Tracking System </h2> <br /><br /><br /><br />
				<p id="intro"> 
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years ago before the advent of modern technology, people were just scribbling					on dried leaves using coals 
					from burned wood as pens. Soon, mankind discovered how to make paper out of trees, while quills and ink came 
					immediately thereafter. Many brilliant minds convened and soon, the concept of technology became the talk of the town.
					Technology improved over the course of time, witnessing the greatest wars in the world, surpassing the most dreadful 
					diseases that humankind has ever faced. And here it is now, continues to be modernized by many of the world's cleverest 
					people with knowledge about computers. We do still write on beautifully made parchments, but none would be easier than 
					creating our letters using many different softwares nowadays such as Microsoft Word. Now, we can create documents using
					these complex machines, save it or share it by any means of "techy" transfer tools. <br /><br />

					Very nice isn't it? How about we realize that in a folder full of documents, each one could just be a speck of dust? 
					How about they each become a butterfly fluttering from one place to another, lost in track? Okay, that was metaphorical 
					but here's the catch: in most companies, transfering documents from one place to another is an essential process. Think 
					about it, what if they get lost? Now imagine departments pointing at each other, each claiming that the other one has 
					the document, and each arguing that they don't have it. Very confusing. My deepest pity to the secretaries. <br /><br />

					That is why after centuries, we have come up with the Document Tracking System-a system that will watch over the 
					documents like an invisible chapperone as they are being passed on to different departments. Now there's no need 
					to worry because the Document Tracking System is here to help you manage and keep track of your documents. From the 
					developers of this Document Tracking System, "HOORAY!"
